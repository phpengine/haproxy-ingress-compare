## Notes

Originally taken from the following github file: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress/master/deploy/haproxy-ingress-daemonset.yaml

There are Instructions here to install without helm, but it's just
to use the file with kubctl apply which we already do.

https://hub.docker.com/r/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress
It mentions kubectl apply -f deploy/haproxy-ingress.yaml
